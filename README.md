# Australian Netflix IPS
Seeing as Netflix doesn't publish their IP ranges I've spent some time getting a list of IPs used for Netflix in Australia.
Mainly this is used to bypass my VPN I've go setup at home in order for Netflix to actually work.

This list will probably change as time goes by and new IPs come up.
